## Getting and Cleaning Data -  Course Project
This is the course project for Coursera online course Getting and Cleaning Data. The R script file `run_analysis.R` does the following:

1.Load the training and test data sets into R

2.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set, appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

3.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

4.Remove the column with duplicate names

5.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

6.creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

##Note
1.You need to download the data to your working directory and unzip it before you use `run_analysis.R` to clean the data.
